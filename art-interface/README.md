## üõ† Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running the Art Decoder application, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Go (Golang)**: Version 1.16 or higher.

   - Download and install Go from https://golang.org/dl/.

   - Verify the installation by running:

     bash

     ```
     go version
     ```

   - If Go is installed correctly, you'll see something like `go version go1.20.3`. If not, revisit the installation steps.

2. **Git**: To clone the repository.

   - Download and install Git from https://git-scm.com/.

   - Verify the installation by running:

     bash

     ```
     git --version
     ```

   - If Git is installed correctly, you'll see something like `git version 2.40.0`. If not, revisit the installation steps.

------

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).

2. Run the following command to download the Art Decoder project:

   bash

   ```
   git clone https://gitea.koodsisu.fi/seankipina/art
   ```

3. Navigate to the project folder:

   bash

   ```
   cd art-decoder/art-interface
   ```

------

### Step 2: Run the Application

1. Start the server by running:

   bash

   ```
   go run main.go
   ```

   - This will start the Art Decoder server on port `8080` by default.
   - **Do not close this terminal window**‚Äîit keeps the server running.

2. Open your web browser and go to:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

   - If everything is working, you should see the Art Decoder web interface.

------

### Step 3: Verify the Server is Running (Optional)

To verify that the server is running, you can use a second terminal window:

1. Open a **new terminal window** (don‚Äôt close the first one where the server is running).

2. Run the following command to check the server status:

   bash

   ```
   curl -I http://localhost:8080
   ```

   - If the server is running correctly, you‚Äôll see a response like this:

     ```
     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     ```

   - If you see an error, make sure the server is running in the first terminal window.

------

### Step 4: Customize the Server (Optional)

You can customize how the server runs using command-line flags. Here are some examples:

| Flag         | Description            | Example Command                   |
| :----------- | :--------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `-port`      | Change the server port | `go run main.go -port=9000`       |
| `-animation` | Disable animations     | `go run main.go -animation=false` |
| `-debug`     | Enable debug mode      | `go run main.go -debug=true`      |
| `-theme`     | Set the default theme  | `go run main.go -theme=vaporwave` |

For example, to run the server on port `9000` with debug mode enabled:

bash

```
go run main.go -port=9000 -debug=true
```

------

### Step 5: Stop the Server

To stop the server, go back to the terminal where it‚Äôs running and press:

- **Ctrl + C** (on Windows, macOS, or Linux).

------

## üì° API Endpoints

The Art Decoder application provides two main API endpoints for encoding and decoding text.

### Decode Endpoint

  json

  ```
  {
    "input": "Text to decode"
  }
  ```

### Encode Endpoint

- **URL**: `/api/encode`

- **Method**: POST

- **Request Body**:

  json

  ```
  {
    "input": "Text to encode"
  }
  ```

------

## üé® Theme Customization

The application supports three unique themes:

1. **Cyberpunk**: Dark, neon-inspired design
